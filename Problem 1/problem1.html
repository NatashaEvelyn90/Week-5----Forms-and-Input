<!-- When you view it on the webpage, it might look really wonky or it might be in a long line.
 So if you add the <br> option at the end , it will put them in line but the "message" section might still be off.
 This is okay as that can always be fixed and adjusted when you are learning CSS. This is just for us to understand Forms. -->
